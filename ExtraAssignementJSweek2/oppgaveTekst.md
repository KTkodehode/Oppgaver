## READ CAREFULLY!!

## Complete the function below to accomplish the following:

## Return the string received in the first parameter with the following alterations:

## any letter in the string matching charA (the second parameter in the function) will be replaced with

## charB (the third parameter) and VICE VERSA - meaning letters matching charA will be replaced with charB,

## and letters matching charB will be replaced with charA. See the expected console log comments below.

function doubleSwap(string, charA, charB) {}

console.log(doubleSwap("this is a string", "i", "s"));
console.log(doubleSwap("m#ybe #nother #ppro#ch is necess#ry", "#", "a"));
console.log(doubleSwap("what is the point of this?", "o", "t"));
console.log(doubleSwap("CghJh%!&hu78UHb(gb!hdsl#dakgf!dal!", "g", "!"));
console.log(doubleSwap("let's do one last test", "l", "e"));

## this should log the following:

## thsi si a itrsng

## maybe another approach is necessary

## whao is ohe ptino tf ohis?

## C!hJh%g&hu78UHb(!bghdsl#dak!fgdalg
