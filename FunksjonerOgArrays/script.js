                 and with each iteration it will call your provided callback function.

                 Example behaviour, lets say you named your function forEach, if we call it with:
                 forEach(threeFruits, console.log) // would display:

/* Excercise #6: Similar to task 5, but instead of first declaring a function and then writing a loop by hand:
                 Use an array method that loops through an array, and provide a callback function that will either console log or display each array element

                 Bonus task: see if you can get the array-method to also display the index of each element in addition to just the element, for example:
                             apple at index 0
                             banana at index 1

                 the following (replace someArrayMethod with an actual array method, and yourCallBackFunctionLogic with some code)
                 here it should multiply each element by 3 and then tripleNums should contain all the numbers multiplied by 3:

                 let tripleNums = nums.someArrayMethod(...yourCallBackFunctionLogic...)
                 console.log(tripleNums) // [3,6,9,12,15]

/* Excercise #8: Use a different array method that will return a new array based on some filter,
                 For example lets say we just want odd numbers from the nums array:
